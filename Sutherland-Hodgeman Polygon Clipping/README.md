# Sutherland-Hodgman Polygon Clipping Algorithm with Qt and OpenGL

This project showcases the implementation of the Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm for polygon clipping using Qt and OpenGL.

## Overview

The Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm is employed for clipping polygons against a rectangular clipping window. This implementation demonstrates the algorithm's functionality within a Qt-based application utilizing OpenGL for rendering.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of polygon representation
- Familiarity with coordinate systems and vector operations
- Qt framework installed
- OpenGL library and development headers

## Getting Started
