# Bresenham Line Algorithm Implementation with Qt and OpenGL

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Bresenham line algorithm using Qt and OpenGL.

## Overview

The Bresenham line algorithm is an efficient method for drawing a line between two points on a grid-based system. This project showcases its implementation within a Qt and OpenGL environment.

## Prerequisites

- Qt framework installed
- OpenGL library and development headers
- Basic understanding of Qt and OpenGL concepts

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
2. **Dependencies Installation:**
