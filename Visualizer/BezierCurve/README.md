## Introduction

The implementation showcases the utilization of Qt and OpenGL for drawing Bezier curves. Bezier curves are a fundamental concept in computer graphics and modeling, allowing smooth and intuitive curve design through control points.

## Features

- **Bezier Curve Generation:** Construct Bezier curves with varying degrees.
- **Control Point Manipulation:** Interactively manipulate control points to alter the curve's shape.
- **OpenGL Rendering:** Utilize OpenGL for rendering the Bezier curves within a Qt application.
- **Interactive GUI:** Simple user interface for intuitive control over the curves.
