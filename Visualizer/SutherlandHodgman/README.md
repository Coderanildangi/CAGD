## Introduction

The Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm is a widely used method for polygon clipping against an arbitrary clipping window. This project provides an implementation of this algorithm within a Qt and OpenGL environment using Visual Studio, offering efficient polygon clipping capabilities.

## Features

- **Polygon Clipping:** Efficiently clip polygons against a specified clipping window.
- **Qt and OpenGL Integration:** Utilize Qt and OpenGL for graphical representation and visualization of the clipping process.
- **Interactive GUI:** Provide a user interface for defining polygons and clipping windows.
