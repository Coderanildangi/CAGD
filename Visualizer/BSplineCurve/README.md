## Introduction

B-Spline curves offer a flexible way of representing smooth curves widely used in computer graphics and modeling. This project provides an implementation of B-Spline curves within a Qt and OpenGL environment using Visual Studio, allowing efficient manipulation and visualization of curves.

## Features

- **B-Spline Curve Generation:** Create B-Spline curves based on control points and knot vectors.
- **Curve Manipulation:** Operations to modify, transform, and interpolate B-Spline curves.
- **OpenGL Visualization:** Rendering and visualization of B-Spline curves in a graphical environment.

## Getting Started

To run and explore the B-Spline curve implementation in Qt with OpenGL using Visual Studio:

1. Clone this repository:

2. Open the project in Visual Studio.

3. Ensure Qt and OpenGL libraries are properly configured in your Visual Studio environment.

4. Build and run the project to observe the implementation.

## Usage

Explore the project files to understand the implementation of B-Spline curves using Qt and OpenGL. Run the application to interactively create, manipulate, and visualize B-Spline curves.

## Examples

The repository includes examples demonstrating the use of the implemented B-Spline curve functionalities within the Qt and OpenGL environment.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- **Qt Framework:** Utilized for GUI and application structure.
- **OpenGL:** Utilized for rendering and visualization.

Ensure these dependencies are properly installed and configured in your Visual Studio environment.
