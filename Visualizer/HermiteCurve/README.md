## Introduction

Hermit curves offer precise control over curve shapes using control points and tangent vectors. This project focuses on implementing Hermit curves within a Qt and OpenGL environment in Visual Studio, providing tools for curve design and visualization.

## Features

- **Hermit Curve Generation:** Creation of Hermit curves based on control points and tangent vectors.
- **Curve Manipulation:** Operations to modify, transform, and interpolate Hermit curves.
- **OpenGL Visualization:** Rendering and visualization of Hermit curves within a Qt-based graphical environment.

## Getting Started

To run and explore the Hermit curve implementation in Qt with OpenGL using Visual Studio:

1. Clone this repository:

2. Open the project in Visual Studio.

3. Ensure Qt and OpenGL libraries are properly configured in your Visual Studio environment.

## Usage

Explore the project files to understand how Hermit curves are implemented and visualized using Qt and OpenGL. Run the application to interactively create and manipulate Hermit curves and observe their rendering.

## Examples

The repository includes examples demonstrating the usage of the implemented Hermit curve functionalities within the Qt and OpenGL environment.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- **Qt Framework:** Utilized for GUI and application structure.
