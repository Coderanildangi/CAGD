## Introduction

Computer-Aided Geometric Design involves a rich set of algorithms that find extensive application in computer graphics, CAD, and various modeling domains. This repository aims to provide clear, understandable implementations of these algorithms.

### Covered Algorithms

This repository encompasses a broad range of algorithms including, but not limited to:

- Bezier curves 
- Hermite curves
- Bresenham's line drawing algorithm
- Slutherland-Hodgman Polygon clipping algorithm
- Surface reconstruction

## Implemented Algorithms

The repository is organized into separate directories for each algorithm or family of algorithms. Each directory contains detailed implementations and accompanying documentation.

## Prerequisites
